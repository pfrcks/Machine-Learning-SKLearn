# BangPypers July Meetup

## Introduction

The following repository contains notebooks to be used during the BangPypers July meetup. These notebooks are made keeping in mind that the intended audience has very little or no experience with scikit-learn and/or machine learning.

## Installation

* Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/pfrcks/BangPypers-SKLearn.git`
* Assuming you have pip installed run `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`. In case you don't have pip, install it from the following [guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
* This repo is a work in process. To keep yourself updated issue a `git pull` before attending the workshop to be on the latest version.
* That's it.

## Requirements

* Dependencies - All the requirements are taken care by requirements.txt file.

* Working knowledge of Python

## Notes

* This workshop has been developed with the intended audience as people with little or no experience of scikit-learn and/or machine learning. 

## Credits where credit's due

* These notebooks owe a lot to the notebooks published by [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) and [Andreas Muller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80fZrVMurPM), who have a much more extensive coverage of the topics. If you want to go further in regards to the black box approach with scikit-learn, I would highly recommend going through their notebooks and screencasts. These tutorials helped me a lot in understanding scikit-learn and it's application.
